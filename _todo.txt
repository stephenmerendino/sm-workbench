Current Tasks
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
New Features
    [x] Implement mouse movement functionality in input system
    [x] Use convention of <system/struct>_<function> eg. renderer_init, camera_update, mesh_add_vertex, vertex_init
    [x] get shader debugging working in render doc with shader debug info working too
    [x] Generate mip maps for viking room diffuse texture
    [x] Shader hot reload
    [x] Debug labels for vulkan submits
    [x] Debug names for vulkan objects
    [] Post processs pass w/ compute shader
    [] Object selection in scene w/ gizmo control
        [] a gizmo control renders at the location of the selected object
        [] gizmo respond to user clicking and dragging for translation, rotation, and scale
        [] objects render out an object id to a full screen buffer
        [] when user clicks on the screen we run a compute shader to return the object id of the pixel clicked on
            [] if the user clicked on a valid object id, then we "select" that object in the scene
        [] selected object has a outline effect drawn around it

Improvements
    [] Improve how ui system communicates to rest of engine / game
    [] Maximized window support
    [] Borderless fullscreen support
    [] Dedicated fullscreen support
    [] Copy over needed runtime asset data to the run folder and make the run folder the working directory
    [] Can we use hardware srgb texture format to get rid of manual gamma correction?
    [] Move game module to a dll and load it from engine with hooks for engine to call
    [] Refactor existing frame code to make it easier to annotate with debug information
    [] Refactor upload_buffer_data
        -Right now its setting up a staging buffer and command buffer inside, once we have a better staging buffer strategy we should change this
    [] Move the expansion of shader filename to full path out of the win32 specific code to somewhere agnostic

Bugs
    NONE ATM
