[x] Infinite Grid
[x] Vulkan debug markers (https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_EXT_debug_marker.html)
[x] Info window
	[x] Camera position
	[x] Current Resolution
[x] Render Settings Window
	[x] Enable/Disable grid
	[x] Grid fade distance
	[x] Line thicknesses
[x] Hide UI button on bar
[x] Convert shaders to hlsl
[x] Runtime HLSL compilation into SPIR-V
	[x] Hot reload shaders
[x] Can't push origin from command line git
[x] Fix bug with infinite grid shader after hlsl conversion
[] Compute shader post processing
	[x] CPU Side compute shader compilation
	[x] Make a new texture to store post processing in
		It needs to be
		storage image - post processing shader
		render target - imgui will draw to it
		transfer src - need to copy to back buffer
	[x] Vulkan pipelines need to support compute shaders
	[x] Simple color tinting post processing compute shader
	[x] Need to get a graphics/compute queue handle to use, and we could also grab an async compute handle too while we're at it for the future?
	[x] Compute shader descriptor sets
		Input texture
		Output texture
	[x] Need to make main draw resolved color buffer a storage image so we can read it in post process compute shader
	[] Synchronization primitives for new post processing pass
	[] Dispatch in between main draw and imgui
	[] Do manual gamma correction (https://registry.khronos.org/DataFormat/specs/1.3/dataformat.1.3.html#TRANSFER_SRGB)
	[] Remove gamma correction from main draw shaders
	[] Modify clear color to be srgb with pow(x, 2.2f)
[] Transform gizmo
	[] Gizmo works on viking room
		[] Translation
		[] Rotation
		[] Scale
    [] Meshes are selectable
    [] Meshes have highlight when selected
    [] Meshes can be deselected
[] Better line rendering
    https://atyuwen.github.io/posts/antialiased-line/
	[] Better grid visuals
[] Debug rendering system (sphere, line, aabb3d, screenspace rect, etc)
[] Basic direct lighting
	[] Lights need to be selectable and translatable & rotatable in the scene
[] Fix bug with window resizing
[] Enable fullscreen button in top right
[] Windowed fullscreen
[] Dedicated fullscreen
[] PBR materials
[] Sponza scene w/ some hardcoded lights setup
[] Skybox
