Tasks
[x] Implement mouse movement functionality in input system
[x] Use convention of <system/struct>_<function> eg. renderer_init, camera_update, mesh_add_vertex, vertex_init
[] upload_buffer takes a command buffer instead of internally using a one time submit command buffer
	[] how will the staging buffer part work? do we pass a staging buffer in too?
[] get shader debugging working in render doc with shader debug info working too
[] Post processs pass w/ compute shader
	[] move gamma correction to post processing shader
[] Object selection in scene w/ gizmo control
    [] objects render out an object id to a full screen buffer
    [] when user clicks on the screen we run a compute shader to return the object id of the pixel clicked on
        [] if the user clicked on a valid object id, then we "select" that object in the scene
	[] a gizmo control renders at the location of the selected object
	[] gizmo respond to user clicking and dragging for translation, rotation, and scale
	[] selected object has a outline effect drawn around it

Bugs
[] When I move away from the viking room it turns black
