New Features
[x] Implement mouse movement functionality in input system
[x] Use convention of <system/struct>_<function> eg. renderer_init, camera_update, mesh_add_vertex, vertex_init
[x] get shader debugging working in render doc with shader debug info working too
[x] Generate mip maps for viking room diffuse texture
[x] Shader hot reload
[] Debug labels for vulkan submits
[] Debug names for vulkan objects
[] Post processs pass w/ compute shader
[] Object selection in scene w/ gizmo control
    [] objects render out an object id to a full screen buffer
    [] when user clicks on the screen we run a compute shader to return the object id of the pixel clicked on
        [] if the user clicked on a valid object id, then we "select" that object in the scene
	[] a gizmo control renders at the location of the selected object
	[] gizmo respond to user clicking and dragging for translation, rotation, and scale
	[] selected object has a outline effect drawn around it
[] Can we use hardware srgb texture format to get rid of manual gamma correction?

Improvements
[] Rework upload_buffer_data
	-Right now its setting up a staging buffer and command buffer inside, once we have a better staging buffer strategy we should change this
[] Improve how ui communicates to rest of engine
